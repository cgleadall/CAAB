Copy As A Backup:

Simple tool to copy a folder - and its children - to a different location. Usually this 'other' location will 
be an external drive.


Problem: 
Backup software solutions sometimes store your data in some proprietory format.

Solution:
Manually copy your 'My Documents' folder to your external drive (or network storage).
